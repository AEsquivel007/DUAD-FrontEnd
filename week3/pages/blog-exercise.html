                Blogging is far from dead. As the last two years of X-formerly-Twitter
                drama has shown, allowing a social media platform to control your
                access to your audience
                <a href="">has big risks</a>
                . If you want a platform where you can share your thoughts properly
                and keep control of things, it's impossible to beat a blog. Plus, you
                can always share your blog posts on social media, through a
                newsletter, and anywhere else. The whole point of a blog is that it's
                your content to do with as you will.

            </div>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <div class="second-content">
                    <div class="learn-how">
                        <div class="promote-content">
                            <p>
                                Promote and publish your content with automation
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="learn">Learn how</button>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, if you run a business and want to provide resources and
                        recommendations to customers, the best way to do it is often to add a
                        blog to your website. Best of all, your blog content gets indexed by
                        Google—unlike almost all social media posts—so you can drive potential
                        customers to your business through content marketing (and without having
                        to pay for ads). Look at the blog you're reading right now: Zapier blog
                        posts get millions of views per month and are one of the most valuable
                        ways of getting new customers at Zapier.
